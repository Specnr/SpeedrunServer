# Speedrun Server

This is a 1.16.1 vanilla speedrun-optimized server with scripts used to optimize the resetting process
with seed-input options for FSG.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Java
- Some way to run shell scripts

## Reccomended Setup

I use Google Cloud Platform's compute engine with a virtual machine running Linux. I have 32GBs of RAM
and 8 vCPUs to speedup the world creation time, but change jvmArgs.txt to be whatever works for you

If you're a technical person I'd look into GCP's $300 free credits, you can set up a pretty great server,
and as long as you stop if after youre done playing, you can very resonably pay nothing for it.
