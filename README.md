# Speedrun Server

This is a 1.16.1 vanilla speedrun-optimized server with scripts used to optimize the resetting process,
with single command FSG runs

## Usage

Download the latest release then download [Minecraft 1.16.1 Server Jar](https://www.minecraft.net/tr-tr/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-16-1)
and move it into the folder

To use it just run the reset.sh shell script. If you want to run a particular seed, pass it
in as an argument. If no argument is given it will leave the seed blank.

Ex: `./reset.sh 2483313382402348964`

To run FSG, run the fsgReset.sh shell script, it will generate a seed and start the server with that seed.

Ex: `./fsgReset.sh`
